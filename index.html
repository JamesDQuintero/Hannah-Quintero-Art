        		Hannah Naomi Quintero is currently based in San Antonio, Texas. The mediums that she primarily works in are acrylic and water mixable oils. As a teenager, she practiced drawing in her spare time by mainly using photos and anime characters as reference photos. Hannah’s parents bought her her first easel and a set of acrylic paints as a Christmas present when she was a freshman in high school. From then on, Hannah taught herself how to paint and her passion for painting grew.
        <br>
        <br>
            	She received her Bachelors of Art in Psychology with a minor in Art from the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in 2012 and at the moment has a Masters in Art Therapy degree in progress from Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College in Indiana. Hannah cannot really say where her interest in art started, only that she was very little and enjoyed scribbling on anything that was paper. Art has always been a lifelong passion of hers and she delved into it more while she attended college and long after graduation.

      Hannah’s paintings reflect experiences in her life along with daily observations that she has seen throughout the years from friends, acquaintances, and family. Each one represents a miracle no matter how minute, obscure, or grandiose.
<br>
<br>
			She and her family have experienced miracles over the years big and small. Fragility and vulnerability are ever present throughout her pieces. Hannah’s larger pieces represent more serious or larger scale miracles and obstacles whereas the smaller canvases represent the least likely of miracles that people as a whole may pass by without so much a second glance.
<br>
<br>
			Hannah incorporates poetry and harmonizes nature in Biblical figurative art to give a sense of storytelling. Every story is open to interpretation and is meant to invoke and inspire calm happiness that brings a sense of peace. Life is taken for granted in the large scheme of things and we tend to not appreciate what we have not materially, but internally. The world is immersed in so much negativity and sorrow that everyone needs a glimpse of faith and hope to see that God’s light is present.
